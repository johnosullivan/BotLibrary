# Bot Library

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bot Library was born out of curiosity. BL is meant to act as the buffer between block and hard coding of robotics components. The goal is to foster individual's from a younger age into the field of AI and robotics. Hopefully Bot Library will reduce the barrier of intimidation towards the subject."
